# Explanation:
## reverseString Method:

- This method takes a string **(str)** as input.
- It uses a StringBuilder object to reverse the string.
- The **reverse()** method of StringBuilder reverses the string in place.
- The reversed string is then converted back to a regular string using the toString() method and returned.

## main Method:

- An instance of the StringReversal class is created.
- The reverseString method is called with different example strings.
- The original and reversed strings are printed to the console.

## Output:

When we run this program, the output will be:
```yaml
    Original1: Hello, World!
    Reversed1: !dlroW ,olleH
  
    Original2: Java Programming
    Reversed2: gnimmargorP avaJ
```
**This example demonstrates how the reverseString method works and how to use it within a simple Java application.**
