# Explanation:
## 1. DuplicateRemover Class:
   The `DuplicateRemover` class contains the `removeDuplicates` method, which is designed to remove duplicate elements from an array of integers while maintaining the original order of elements.

## 2. removeDuplicates Method:
**Input:**

- An array of integers `arr` that may contain duplicate values.

**Using LinkedHashSet:**

- The method uses a `LinkedHashSet` to store the elements of the array.
- A `Set` inherently ensures that all elements are unique, so any duplicates from the array will be automatically removed.
- `LinkedHashSet` is specifically used to maintain the order of insertion, ensuring that the original order of elements is preserved.

**Converting Set to Array:**

- After populating the `Set`, the method creates a new array `result` with the size equal to the number of unique elements (size of the set).
- The method then iterates over the `Set` to copy the unique elements back into the array.

**Return:**

- The method returns the newly created array `result`, which contains only the unique elements from the original array.
## 3. main Method:
**Array Initialization:**

- An array `arrayWithDuplicates` is initialized with some duplicate values, such as `{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9}`.

**Removing Duplicates:**

- The `removeDuplicates` method is called with `arrayWithDuplicates` as the input, and the result is stored in the `arrayWithoutDuplicates` variable.

**Output:**

- The final array without duplicates is printed to the console using `Arrays.toString()` to display the contents of the array.

# Outputs:

When we run this program, the output will be:

```yaml
Array without duplicates: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
- The duplicates `2`, `4`, `7`, and `9` from the original array are removed.
- The order of elements is preserved, as seen in the output.

# Conclusion:
This program demonstrates how to remove duplicate values from an array of integers using a `Set` to enforce uniqueness while preserving the original order of elements with a `LinkedHashSet`. This method is efficient and straightforward, making it suitable for various scenarios where duplicate removal is needed.
